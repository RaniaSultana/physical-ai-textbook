# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook for teaching Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This course covers foundational concepts, hands-on labs, and capstone projects to equip students with the skills to design, simulate, and deploy intelligent robotic systems.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will:

- **Understand robot architectures** — Grasp the principles of the Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2 middleware)
- **Model and simulate** — Build digital twins and run physics-based simulations (NVIDIA Isaac)
- **Train vision models** — Use visual language agents (VLA) to enable perception and manipulation
- **Deploy on hardware** — Work with real humanoid platforms and microcontrollers
- **Design capstone systems** — Integrate all concepts into a full-stack robotic application

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized into 4 core modules plus hands-on labs and a capstone project:

- **Module 1: Robotic Nervous System** — ROS 2 fundamentals, node architecture, and communication
- **Module 2: Digital Twin & Simulation** — Creating virtual replicas, physics engines, and behavior testing
- **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac & Perception** — Sim-to-real transfer, sensor integration, and perception pipelines
- **Module 4: Vision & Language Agents (VLA)** — Multimodal models, prompt engineering, and real-world task learning

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming (3+ years experience recommended)
- Familiarity with Linux/Unix command line
- Understanding of robotics fundamentals (kinematics, dynamics) is helpful but not required

## How to Use This Textbook

Each module is split into **weekly chapters** with theory, code examples, and hands-on exercises. Start with Module 1 if you're new to robotics; skip ahead if you have prior ROS experience.

For classroom use:
- Assign one module per 2–3 weeks
- Use the **Hardware Lab** section to plan real-world experiments
- Have students complete the **Capstone Project** in teams during the final 4 weeks

For self-study:
- Work through modules sequentially
- Run code examples in a Docker container or virtual machine
- Post questions in the course discussion forum
